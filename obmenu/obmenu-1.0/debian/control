Description: Graphical menu editor for openbox
 Obmenu is a graphical menu editor for the Openbox window manager.
 Openbox uses XML to store its menu preferences, and editing these by hand
 can quickly become tedious. This utility provides a convenient method of
 editing the menu in a graphical interface, while not losing the powerful
 features of Openbox such as its pipe menus.
 .
 This also provides a Python module named obxml that can be used to further
 script Openbox's menu system.
